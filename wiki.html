<div> Sleep is a state of reduced mental and physical activity in which consciousness is altered and certain sensory activity is inhibited. <br>
During sleep, there is a marked decrease in muscle activity and interactions with the surrounding environment.<br>
While sleep differs from wakefulness in terms of the ability to react to stimuli, it still involves active brain patterns, making it more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness.</div><br>
